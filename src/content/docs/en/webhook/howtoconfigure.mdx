title: How to Set Up the Discord Webhook
---

This guide explains how to set up the API webhook to send notifications to Discord.

## Prerequisites

- Have administrative access to the Discord server

## Step 1: Install the Arkyn Bot on the server

11280

1. Access the bot's [Authorization URL](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1393844236054433832&scope=bot&permissions=536947728)

2. Select the Discord server where you want to install the bot.

3. Make sure the necessary permissions are checked:

- **Read Messages/View Channels**: To access channels.
- **Send Messages**: To send notifications.
- **Read Message History**: To check previous messages.

4. Click **"Authorize"** to install the bot.

## Step 2: Get the Channel ID

1. In Discord, go to **User Settings** (gear icon).

2. In **App Settings**, enable **Developer Mode**.

3. Navigate to the channel where you want to receive notifications.

4. Right-click the channel name.

5. Select **"Copy ID"** from the context menu.

6. Save this ID—you'll need it to set up the webhook.

## Step 3: Configure Channel Permissions

Make sure the bot has the necessary permissions in the channel. Selected:

1. Right-click the channel

2. Select "Edit Channel"

3. Go to the "Permissions" tab

4. Search for the bot in the member/role list

5. Ensure the following permissions are enabled:

- ✅ **View Channel**
- ✅ **Send Messages**
- ✅ **Read Message History**

  **Difficulties with permissions?** If you are unable to configure the bot's
  permissions within the server, you can install the bot as an administrator
  using this [Authorization URL with administrative
  permissions](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1393844236054433832&scope=bot&permissions=8).

## Step 4: Update the Webhook in the API

1. Access the [webhook update endpoint](/en/webhook/updatewebhook)

2. Use the channel ID copied in Step 2

3. Update the webhook configuration with the new channel ID

## Verification

After configuring the webhook:

1. Send a test message through the API
2. Verify that the notification appears in the configured Discord channel
3. Confirm that the message format is correct

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not appearing on the server

- Check that you have administrative permissions on the server
- Try reinstalling the bot using the authorization URL

### Messages not sending

- Confirm that the channel ID is correct
- Check the bot's permissions in the channel
- Make sure the webhook is enabled in the API

### Bot without permissions

- Go to channel settings
- Add the necessary permissions manually
- Or adjust the bot's role permissions on the server

## Important Notes

- The channel ID is unique and specific to each channel
- Permissions can be inherited from the server settings
- Keep the channel ID secure, as it grants access to the specific channel
- The bot will only work on servers where it has been authorized

**Tip**: For quick testing, you can send a manual message in the channel and check if the bot can "see" the message using the configured permissions.
