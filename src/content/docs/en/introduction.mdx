The Arkyn Logs API is a complete solution for monitoring and analyzing web application logs. This API allows you to collect, store, and analyze HTTP traffic data, application logs, and more, providing valuable insights into the behavior and performance of your applications.

## ðŸš§ Project Status

This API is currently in the testing phase and under active development. New features are being added regularly, and some changes may occur during this period.

## ðŸ“š Postman Collection

To facilitate testing and exploring the API, we've made a complete collection available on Postman with examples of all routes and endpoints:

**[Access Collection on Postman](https://www.postman.com/sancton-dev-team/workspace/arkyn-logs-api)**

The collection includes:

- Examples of all available routes
- Sample data for testing
- Inline documentation for each endpoint
- Predefined environment configurations

## ðŸ”— Integration with @arkyn/server

The Arkyn Logs API was designed to have **full integration** with the `@arkyn/server` library, providing:

- **Automatic monitoring** of application logs
